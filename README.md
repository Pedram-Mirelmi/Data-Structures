# Data-Structures
some data structures in cpp (tried to code clean:) ) <br />
I added a simple maze project that uses dijkstra algorithm and BTree to find the lighters way from source to destination

# Btree:
The Btree uses my own linked list which has extra methods

# Linked List:
As mentioned above, the linked list has many extra features 

# Min(max) Heap:
Min Heap tree implemented by array

# Red-Black Tree
Red-Black tree
